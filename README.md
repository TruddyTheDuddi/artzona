### How to run
If you want to run this locally, set up an apache environment that can run PHP (I use MAMP), clone it inside your `htdocs` folder or any other place where you can launch it from under a localhost, and voil√†! 

If you want to look at static `.html` files (no PHP nor XHR HTTP requests), you can drag and drop them directly into your browser.
